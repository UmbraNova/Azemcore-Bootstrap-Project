I crafted this dynamic and responsive website using CSS, HTML, Javascript and Bootstrap.
Leveraging Bootstrap's powerful framework,
I meticulously researched and integrated all the visuals while keeping the 
responsive design that seamlessly
adapts to various devices. One of the notable challenges was integrating images and combining colors.
This project not only showcased my technical skills but also highlighted my adaptability
and commitment to delivering impactful web solutions
